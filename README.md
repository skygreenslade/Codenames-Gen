### If you're reading this, please tell me what they are called 


> designed to allow me and my friends to play codenames through videocalls.

## Usage:

- Start a videocall including a view of the game board
- Two people (as codemasters) run the generator to get a card. if codemasters are not local to eachother, send the other one a picture or something.
- ~~Destroy your opponents~~ Have fun!

If you have Python, just run ui.py with Python. Otherwise, download a file from the list below.

## Executables

These files can be downloaded individually from the "executables" folder.
