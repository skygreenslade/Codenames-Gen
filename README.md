### If you're reading this, please tell me what they are called 


> designed to allow me and my friends to play codenames through videocalls.

## Usage:

- videocall includes a view of the game board
- two people (as codemasters) run the generator to get a card. if codemasters are not local to eachother, send the other one a picture or something.

## Notes

- PyInstall (used to generate executable) has to be run on the OS for the executable to be run on. 
- Currently includes Linux executable.
